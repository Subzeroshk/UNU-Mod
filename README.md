# UNU-Mod
UNU: Unoffical Nether Mod is a Minecraft nether mod that adds some much needed content to the nether. This repository is going to be used for all releases including alpah/beta versions. I am very open to suggestions, contrabutions etc. Currently I am working on completely redoing it as I haven't touched it in 2 years.
